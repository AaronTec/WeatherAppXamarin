# WeatherAppXamarin

A GitHub Portfolio would incomplete without a Weather app of some kind, so here it is!

In this school exercise we had to create a weather app that followed these guidlines.

• Connect to a web API to get the weather data.

• Have preferences which can be changed from a settings screen. The preferences should also be saved.

• Use a utility class to convert units as needed (rainfall, temperature, etc)

• Have multiple screens, not counting the preferences screen. The seperate screens should all display weather data
of some sort but it’s up to you what you put where.

• Look good.

• Be planned before written.

• Be well tested

I decided that I wanted to add a couple of more feature that would make this App more useful.

• Display the forecast for the next week

• Have a list view of all the days in the week and have it display more information about the selected day.

• Have an weather icon to display the current weather type.
